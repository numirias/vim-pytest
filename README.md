# Vim ❤️ Pytest

This plugin aims to integrate pytest into Vim, so you can run tests and evaluate results without leaving the editor.

Note that this is a work in progess and currently only supports Neovim. (But Vim 8 support is planned.)

## Demo

Features include running either selected tests or the entire suite, showing the current test stage and outcome in the sign column,   displaying pytest output in a split window (with syntax highlighting!), and there are hopefully more features to come.

Let me know if you'd like to contribute.
